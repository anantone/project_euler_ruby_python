# PROJECT EULER RUBY PYTHON

These are my solutions to the puzzles on projecteuler.net

The aim is to solve each puzzle in both Ruby and Python, to see how the
languages compare and brush up on both.

I am interested in discussing and comparing solutions with others.

Discussion and patches can be sent, with subject line starting with [PROJECT
EULER RUBY], to this mailing list: ~kotp/OneAntsOutstandingOdysey@lists.sr.ht
